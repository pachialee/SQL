#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

---$1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM bit_db.JanSales
WHERE length (orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID'
;

---#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM bit_db.JanSales
WHERE Product ='iPhone'
AND orderid<>'Order ID'
;

---#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM bit_db.customers cust

INNER JOIN bit_db.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderid
WHERE length (orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID'
;

---#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM bit_db.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT min(price) FROM bit_db.JanSales)
;
#OR
SELECT distinct product, price FROM bit_db.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1
;

---#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM bit_db.JanSales
GROUP BY product
;

---#6. Which products were sold in FEBRUARY AT 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
SUM(Quantity),
product,
SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM bit_db.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product
;

---#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT
COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
